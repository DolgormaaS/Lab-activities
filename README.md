<h2> 1. Experiment with file permissions on Linux Bash Shell </h2>

- chmod command 
- Permissions are important to ensure security confidentiality.
- [File permissions with Linux](https://github.com/Usagitejima/Lab-activities/blob/6f7df84f987de16dc48b4c58ce84675d29b6caf5/File%20permissions%20in%20Linux.pdf)

<h2> 2. Using 'AND' 'OR' and 'NOT' keywords to write SQL queries </h2>

- I used 'AND' 'OR' and 'NOT' keywords to write SQL queries to filter out specific information.
- [Apply filter queried to SQL queries](https://github.com/Usagitejima/Lab-activities/blob/bdbe772f3e4bb0a61bf0821b8b05be27b9a3babd/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries.pdf)

<h2> 3. Python algorithm for file updates </h2>

- I developed Python algorithm that updates list of IP addresses of a file based on which IP addresses to remove.
